# Subdomain: wallet.htttoken.eth

This folder contains the decentralized frontend for the ENS subdomain **wallet.htttoken.eth**, deployed via IPFS and linked through ENS.

## 🌐 Purpose

Frontend for connecting MetaMask and viewing HTT token balance.

## 📁 Files

- `index.html` – Main entry point
- Any associated assets (CSS, JS) can be placed here or linked from shared `/assets/`

## 🚀 Deployment

1. Zip this folder.
2. Upload to [https://web3.storage](https://web3.storage) or your preferred IPFS pinning service.
3. Copy the resulting CID.
4. Set the content hash for `wallet.htttoken.eth` in [https://app.ens.domains](https://app.ens.domains)

## 🔐 Notes

- Only the ENS domain owner can update the live version.
- Modifying this folder does not affect `.eth.limo` output until IPFS and ENS are updated.
